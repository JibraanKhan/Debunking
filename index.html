      <h2>It takes on average 2 - 6 months to make a casual game.</h1>
      <p>It has been shown over time that a casual game takes around 2 - 6 months to make,
      while typical AAA games average 18 - 36 months to make. Some of the bigger titles
      have taken up to 5 years long to make.

         They think that making a game is an easy process that takes, at the most, a month.

         Even the casual games that do not make it very big in the industry take at the
         least 2 months of dedication towards, which entails working basically every day
          of the week, so it is clear that games are by far really difficult to make,
          produce, and market at the same time â€“ despite the fact that large projects
          have thousands of people working on it.
